                            The Continuous Electrode Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (CE-IEC) Fusor
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            A cutaway of the truncated icosahedron inertial electrostatic confinement fusor (<a href="http://andrewchap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SedwickChapPatent.pdf">patent</a>) with the electric potential and magnetic field lines plotted.
                           The geometry is that of a truncated icosahedron (buckyball) modified so that the hexagonal and pentagonal faces have equal area.
                           The symmetric half of the structure closer to the viewer is hidden to reveal the nature of the core region, where fuel ions have been accelerated to fusion velocities.
                           Walls extend from the inner radius to the outer radius, and are always aligned with the center point so as to maximize their transparency to the fusion products generated in the device center.
                           Wall exteriors are biased to potentials varying radially in a manner that focuses and compresses the passing ion packets.
                           Radially polarized permanent magnets along the wall interiors prevent the transverse expansion of the ion packets and also serve to confine electrons.
                           I created the geometry, calculated the fields, and visualized it all in <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Matlab</span>.

                            Simultaneous-turn-based Strategy Game
                        </h5>
			<p>
			    This was a fun project of mine during one of my summers at NASA: a rudimentary computer game . It is designed to eliminate the drawbacks of both turn-based strategy games (which are not practical for MMO) and real-time strategy games (where multitasking becomes more important than strategy). During each turn, each player gives commands to each of their units, then the commands are executed in a real-time fashion for a set amount of time, then the game is “paused” while players reassess and issue new commands to their units. In this version, the game lasts one turn, and I play as red, issuing commands to units that otherwise default to moving towards and attacking the nearest unit.
